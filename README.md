As a passionate and results-driven Senior Web Developer at Vedic Fashion, I specialize in creating high-performing, user-centric web experiences that blend functionality with aesthetic appeal. With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I thrive on transforming business needs into elegant, scalable digital solutions.

Previously, I served as a Fraud/SAP Analyst at TTEC, where I gained valuable experience in data analysis, risk mitigation, and SAP system management. This unique blend of analytical and technical skills allows me to approach development with a business-first mindset, ensuring every project aligns with strategic goals.

My core strengths include:

Full-stack web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, PHP, etc.)

E-commerce platforms & integrations

Responsive design & performance optimization

SAP systems & data analysis

Cross-functional collaboration

I’m constantly exploring new technologies and tools to stay ahead in the ever-evolving web landscape. Whether it’s leading a development team or diving deep into code, I bring energy, creativity, and attention to detail to every challenge.

Let’s connect – I’m always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, and growth opportunities in the tech and fashion-tech space.
